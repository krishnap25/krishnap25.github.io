## Packages


[**Mauve**](https://github.com/krishnap25/mauve) ([Documentation](krishnap25.github.io/mauve/))  
A package to compute the Mauve score for neural text generation. Install as `pip install mauve-text`.
It is also supported via the [HuggingFace Datasets](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/how_to_metrics.html) package. 

[**SQwash**](https://github.com/krishnap25/sqwash) ([Documentation](https://krishnap25.github.io/sqwash/))   
Distributionally robust learning in PyTorch with 1 additional line of code. Install as `pip install sqwash`. 

[**Geom-Median**](https://github.com/krishnap25/geom_median)  
Fast and Differentiable Geometric Median in PyTorch and NumPy. Install as `pip install geom-median`. 

[**Casimir**](https://github.com/krishnap25/casimir) ([Documentation](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pillutla/documentation/casimir/))  
A toolbox of selected optimization algorithms for unstructured tasks such as binary classification, and structured prediction tasks such as visual object localization and named entity recognition.

[**RFA**](https://github.com/google-research/federated/tree/master/robust_aggregation)
TensorFlow Federated Implementation of robust aggregation for federated learning using the geometric median.
