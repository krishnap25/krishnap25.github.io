I am a student of [Pt. Iman Das](https://www.facebook.com/imandasvocal/) for Hindustani classical music in the style of the [Patiala Gharana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patiala_gharana). In a past life, I used to play guitar in a rock/metal band. 

I am interested in the fusion of Western music with Indian Classical music.
 My wonderful grandmother -  who played the
 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saraswati_veena">Veena</a> - and I had quite a blast making some fusion music.

* I greatly enjoy spending time outdoors. The Pacific Northwest offers some great hiking and backpacking opportunities.
* I also enjoy being around mountains. I have been up to the summit of [Stok Kangri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stok_Kangri), at an altitude of 6,121 m (20,082 ft). 
* Back in the day, I represented IIT Bombay in basketball, a sport I greatly enjoy.
