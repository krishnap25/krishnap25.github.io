I'm a visiting researcher (postdoc) at Google Research in the Federated Learning team. I'm broadly interested in machine learning, artificial intelligence, optimization, robustness, and privacy, and specifically in the setting of federated learning, and text generation.

I obtained my PhD from the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the **University of Washington**,
where I was fortunate to be advised by [Zaid Harchaoui](http://faculty.washington.edu/zaid/) and [Sham Kakade](https://sham.seas.harvard.edu/).
Before that, I worked with [Nina Balcan](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ninamf/) for my Master's at **Carnegie Mellon University** and received an undergraduate degree from IIT Bombay.

My research has been recognized by [a NeurIPS outstanding paper award](https://news.cs.washington.edu/2022/02/28/allen-school-and-ai2-researchers-paint-the-neurips-conference-mauve-and-take-home-an-outstanding-paper-award/) and I was a 2019-20 [J.P. Morgan PhD Fellow](https://www.jpmorgan.com/country/US/en/technology/ai/awards/phd-fellowship-award-recipients).

Contact me at [my-last-name] @ cs [dot] washington [dot] edu.
