I am a Ph.D candidate in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the **University of Washington**. 
I am fortunate to be advised by [Zaid Harchaoui](http://faculty.washington.edu/zaid/) and [Sham Kakade](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~sham/).

I'm interested in machine learning, optimization and robustness broadly, and specifically in the setting of federated learning, generative modeling, and structured prediction.
I'm honored to be chosen as a 2019-20 [J.P. Morgan PhD Fellow](https://www.jpmorgan.com/country/US/en/technology/ai/awards/phd-fellowship-award-recipients).

Previously, I worked with [Nina Balcan](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ninamf/) for my Master's at **Carnegie Mellon University**. 
Before that, I was an undergrad at IIT Bombay.

Contact me at [my-last-name] @ cs [dot] washington [dot] edu.
