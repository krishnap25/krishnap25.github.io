I'm a researcher in machine learning and artifical intelligence. I'm interested in ML/AI, optimization and robustness broadly, and specifically in the setting of federated learning, structured prediction, and text generation.

I obtained my PhD from the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering at the **University of Washington**,
where I was fortunate to be advised by [Zaid Harchaoui](http://faculty.washington.edu/zaid/) and [Sham Kakade](https://sham.seas.harvard.edu/).
Before that, I worked with [Nina Balcan](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ninamf/) for my Master's at **Carnegie Mellon University** and received an undergraduate degree from IIT Bombay.

My research has been recognized by [a NeurIPS outstanding paper award](https://news.cs.washington.edu/2022/02/28/allen-school-and-ai2-researchers-paint-the-neurips-conference-mauve-and-take-home-an-outstanding-paper-award/) and I was a 2019-20 [J.P. Morgan PhD Fellow](https://www.jpmorgan.com/country/US/en/technology/ai/awards/phd-fellowship-award-recipients).
